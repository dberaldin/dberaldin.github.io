## Foreword

There is no mandatory reason for a book to start from Chapter 1, isn't there? E.g. for a computer scientist it would feel a lot more natural if the first chapter was named `Chapter 0`. It is just a simple label after all, nothing more than a convention, so why should anyone take too much care of it?

## Rationale

You may be wondering why the author had decised to start writing all this bullshit and why they chose such a horrible means as a text editor and a bunch of markdown files under version control.

It's a long story, so please sit comfortably on your armchair, or wherever you are, and grab yourself something warm do sip as long as you read. And, naturally, if you are really curious to know what this book is about, you find find out by skipping to [the fist chapter](pages/chapter11).
